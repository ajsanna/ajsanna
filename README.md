### üöÄ Featured Projects

üó∫Ô∏è [**BRONCO-RADAR Full Stack Web App**](https://github.com/Placeholder-Group/BroncoRadar)  
*This is a full-stack web application designed to enhance navigation around the Cal Poly Pomona campus through an interactive and responsive campus map. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend leverages Spring Boot and Maven to manage API routes, data flow, and server-side logic. Continuous integration is implemented using GitHub Actions and AWS, allowing for automated deployment and testing workflows. The application is hosted via GitHub Pages, ensuring reliable and fast web access. This project demonstrates effective DevOps practices, backend development with Spring Boot, and scalable deployment strategies in a collaborative, real-world environment.*

üöò [**Autonomous Driving Software Development**](https://github.com/ajsanna/Qcar)  
*Qcar is a Python-based robotics project focused on autonomous vehicle simulation and control, utilizing a range of sensor input methods and control interfaces. It features modular subprojects for working with LiDAR data, keyboard input, and Logitech steering wheel controllers to simulate real-time driving conditions. The project integrates hardware interfacing and sensor data processing to test navigation logic and control algorithms in a flexible development environment. It provides a hands-on platform for exploring autonomous systems, real-time control, and human-in-the-loop interaction.*

üß† [**2025 CPP AI-Hackathon FINALIST**](https://github.com/ajsanna/AI-Hackathon)  
*Infer-X is an AI-powered welding defect detection system developed using the YOLOv8 object detection model. Built for the CPP AI Hackathon, it identifies and localizes welding defects in real-time through a lightweight client-server application. The model was trained on a labeled dataset using PyTorch and evaluated with mean average precision (mAP). It uses OpenCV and PIL for image processing, with a Flask backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for user interaction. The project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in automating industrial quality assurance workflows.*

üî¨ [**Generative AI for Drug Discovery**](https://github.com/ajsanna/drug-generator)  
*This project explores the use of generative AI models for drug discovery by generating novel molecular structures from SMILES strings. It includes implementations of RNNs, VAEs, and Glow models using PyTorch, each trained to learn molecular patterns and produce valid, diverse compounds. The goal is to accelerate drug design through deep learning by modeling the underlying chemical space and generating candidate molecules for further analysis.*

üìã [**.NET Powered Task Management Application**](https://github.com/ajsanna/TaskManager)  
*This is a simple yet functional to-do list application developed as a final project for CS4080 (Concepts of Programming Languages) at Cal Poly Pomona. Built using C# and .NET MAUI, it features a graphical interface that allows users to add, delete, and view tasks, each with associated descriptions, due dates, and priority levels. The application stores tasks locally via a lightweight file-based persistence system, ensuring data is retained across sessions. The project emphasizes GUI design, event-driven programming, and basic state management using XAML and C#.*

üöò [**Lane Detection Software with Computer Vision**](https://github.com/SigsFig/donkey-car)  
*This is a Python-based autonomous vehicle training project that leverages deep learning to control and calibrate a self-driving mini car. The project includes components for data collection, model training, and real-time inference, with configurations tailored for a Donkey Car simulation or physical setup. Core scripts like train.py, calibrate.py, and manage.py handle sensor input, steering angle calibration, and model deployment. The modular design allows easy customization of driving behavior and integration of different hardware setups, making it ideal for experimenting with real-world reinforcement learning and computer vision in autonomous systems.*
